<!--<h1>Code Optimization</h1>-->
<ol>
    <p>We can optimize a solution using both time and space optimization. To optimize a program,</p>
	
    <li>Reduce the time taken to run the program and increase the space occupied.</li>
    <li>Reduce the memory usage of the program and increase its total run time.</li>
    <li>Reduce both time and space complexity by deploying relevant algorithms.</li>
</ol>
